   * Lessons
   * Videos
   * Quizzes
   * Exercises

* There is no built-in way in Udacity to check if you have 100% on all of the lessons, videos, quizzes, and exercises so you should do a manual re-check to confirm

   * You must score 45 out of 50 points or higher (90% or above)
   * You must finish the quiz within 30 minutes
   * Only the top 425 scorers will be selected to receive a full scholarship for phase 2
   * If multiple people are tied in spots for Phase 2, it will come down to random selection

* How fast you finish the course or the assessment quiz will have no bearing whatsoever to your eligibility
* Participation in the AWS Slack Community does not increase your chances to be picked for Phase 2

### Online assessment quiz additional information

* Do NOT click on the quiz link until you are ready to take the quiz. Timing will start immediately
* The quiz will be hosted on SurveyMonkey
* The quiz will have no built-in timer so you have to time yourself
* SurveyMonkey will prompt you about your email. The email you submit here SHOULD MATCH the one you used in Udacity. This is how they will link your score to your Udacity account
* The quiz will be purely Multiple Choice
* Correct answers will NOT be revealed
* All of the questions will be purely based on the course content. That is, you will be able to understand all of the questions if you've finished the course.

### To be announced information / information we're not yet sure of
* Will the assessment quiz be in a locked browser screen or not?
* Will scoring more than 45 points in the assessment quiz have an edge over those who scored 45 points only?
* They said the questions will be randomized, but they didn't say if:
   * there are only 50 questions in total and the order is randomized or
   * there is a question pool more than 50 and each student will be given a random set of 50 questions from that pool
