# AWS-Machine-Learning-Foundations-Scholarship
AWS and Udacity are collaborating to educate developers of all skill levels on machine learning concepts. The goal for this program is to up-level machine learning skills to all, and to cultivate the next generation of ML leaders across the world, with a focus on underrepresented groups. Through this Udacity Powers Tech Program, AWS collaborates with professional organizations that are leading initiatives to increase the diversity and talent in technical roles, including organizations like Girls In Tech and the National Society of Black Engineers.
